2D Arrays:
2D arrays are simple multiple 1D arrays. (2 ,1D arrays together)
we can also think about 2D arrays as a matrix of numbers.
Why we need it?
We can use 2D arrays to store the data which is present in the form of rows and columns.
Syntax:
dataType[][] matrix={
{item,item,item,item},
{item,item,item,item},
{item,item,item,item},
}
int[][] matrix={
{1,5,8,90},
{10,55,80,90},
{1,6,80,95},
}
Second way of creating the array
dataType[][] matrix=new int[5][]//you can put number inside the second one or can leave it empty.
int[][] matrix=new int[5][3]
