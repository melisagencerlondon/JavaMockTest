Abstraction in Java:
     Abstract mean something which is not clear or not complete.
     We use abs.to create methods which are incomplete meaning
     they don't have method headers.
Why should we create abstract methods?
     1)When we know tact every child will be overriding a method we don't need to have a method body.
     2)It acts as a template when we create a method as abstract every child must provide body for that.
     it used to enforce methods on the child classes.
