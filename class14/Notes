Type Of Variables:
There are 3 types of variables in java with respect to scope/visibility/accessibility
1)local
2)instance
3)static
Local Variable:
  Local variable are the variables which are defined inside the block of code
  like if-else statement,loop,switch statement,methods.
  They can only be accessed with-in that block of code.
  Upside:
   They occupy the memory for least amount of time inside your computer.
you should always try to go wiyh local variables.
DownSide:
   They can only be accessed with in the same block where they are created.

Instance Variables:
  The variables which are defined inside a class but outside of a block of code like
  methods,if-else statement,loop,switch etc. are called as instance variables.
  They can be accessed anywhere  in the class except static methods.
Upside:
  They can be accessed anywhere inside a class other than static methods.
DownSide:
  They occupy the memory for longer as compare to a local variable.
//instance is like a private copy
Static Variable:
  Static variables are created using static keyword they are also created
  outside od blocks of codes like methods,loops etc.
UpSide:
we can save a lot of space because for static only one memory location is used
for all the object.
DownSide:
  It occupies the memory for longest. and can hold one copy for all objects.
Access Modifiers:
  Access modifier in java help us the control who can access what.
  There are 4 access levels and we use three keywords to control these levels. private,default,protected and public.

Private:
  Is the most restricted one when used with a variable or method those cant be accessed outside
  of the class
Important note:
  1)99% of the methods are public.
  2)99% of instance fields are created as private.
  3)99% of static fields are public.
  4)99% of the time class are also public.



  public - accessible from anywhere -
  default from within the package
