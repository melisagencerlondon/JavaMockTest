Arrays:
It's a collections of similar items. The data is stored in consecutive memory locations insifde the
 memory. We use indexing to store and access the data in an array.
 Every element that we store in an array is assigned a number these numbers start
 from 0 first element will be assigned number 0 then next one 1 and so on.
 Why we should use arrays:
 its not feasible to use variables for large amounts of dat.
 Storing ,maneging,searching large amonut of data becomes
  easier with arrays and loops.
  Syntax of Arrays:
  We can create arrays in two ways
  1)Datatype[] nameOfArray={item1,item2,item3}
  String[] names={"Kawoon","Patrick","Halil"}
  //index is 2 as it starts from 0
  //size is 3 as there are 3 names
  2)DataType[] nameOfArray=nemw DataType[size]
  int[] numbers= newInt[5]
