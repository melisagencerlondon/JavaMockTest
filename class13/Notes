Methods in Java:
    Methods/Function/Behaviours are block of code.
    They contain statement (lines of code)which are executed when a method is called.
    A method in java has a return type name and parameters/arguments(inputs).
Why should we use methods?
    Methods helps us reuse the code. When we need to share/reuse a piece of code
    within our project or with others we can create our own classes define methods inside those
    classes and we can start reusing/sharing them.
Syntax of the methods:
    returnType(output) nameOfTheMethod (input/parameters){

    }
